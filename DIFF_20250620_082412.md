- Removed non-existent `gh-cli` dependency from setup.py and egg-info metadata.
- Adjusted Makefile to avoid npm operations when no package.json exists; ensured proper tab indentation; added creation of dist dir in deb target.
- Simplified debian/control and added missing copyright file.
- Updated Flatpak manifest to use runtime version 23.08 and dropped node extension and npm build commands.
- Created packaging artifacts for deb build; snap, flatpak, and docker builds failed due to environment limitations.
