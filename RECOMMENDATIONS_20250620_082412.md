## Recommendations 2025-06-20
- Include a LICENSE file in the repository so package metadata can reference it.
- Provide a package.json or remove node-related steps entirely to simplify builds.
- Consider adding checks in the Makefile to create $(DIST_DIR) automatically for all package targets.
- Document that flatpak and snap builds require additional tools and kernel features.
